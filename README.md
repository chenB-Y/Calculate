Calculator Application with Client-Server Model
This project demonstrates a calculator application implemented using Java for the server-side logic and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client-side interface. The client-server model is used to allow multiple clients to perform calculations through a web-based interface.

Features
Basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Web-based user interface for the calculator.
Server-side processing of calculations using Java.
Client-server communication using HTTP requests.
Responsive design with HTML and CSS.
Real-time updates using JavaScript.
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
Web browser with JavaScript enabled.
Usage
Start the server to handle incoming client requests.
Open a web browser and navigate to the client interface.
Perform calculations using the web-based calculator.
The server will process the calculations and send back the results to the client in real-time.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app.git
cd calculator-app
Compile and run the server code:

bash
Copy code
javac Server.java
java Server
Open the client.html file in a web browser to access the calculator interface.

Server
The server-side logic is implemented in Java, using the ServerSocket class to handle incoming client connections. The server processes calculation requests and sends back the results to the clients.

Client
The client-side interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface provides buttons for numbers and operations, and it sends HTTP requests to the server for processing calculations.

Technologies Used
Java for server-side logic.
HTML for creating the structure of the calculator interface.
CSS for styling the interface.
JavaScript for client-side interactivity and communication with the server.
